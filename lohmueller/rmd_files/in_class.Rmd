```{r}
set.seed(12390)
s1 <- rnorm(n = 1000, sd = 1, mean = 0)
s3 <- rnorm(n = 1000, sd = 3, mean = 0)

head(s1); head(s3)

bins <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 1)
bins

counts_s1 <- hist(s1, breaks = bins)$counts
counts_s3 <- hist(s3, breaks = bins)$counts
counts_s1; counts_s3

cols <- c("orange", "purple")

barplot(rbind(counts_s1, counts_s3), beside = T, col = cols, names.arg = seq(from = -10, to = 9.5, by = 1), width = 2)
legend("topleft", col = cols, pch = 19, 
       legend = c(expression(paste(sigma, "= 1")), expression(paste(sigma, "= 3"))), bty = "n")

```


### A cool trick
```{r}
mean(s1 > 3)

mean(c(T, F, F, F))
```
