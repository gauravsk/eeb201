### Mini exercise 3.2.1

Tweaking parameters of discrete growth model


```r
# conditions & parameters (these are new!)
generations <- 100
RR <- 0.9 # R is a parameter
N_init <- 100 # N is a state variable

# create and populate pop size vector
pop_sizes <- numeric(generations)
pop_sizes[1] <- N_init
for (time in 2:generations){
  pop_sizes[time] <- RR*pop_sizes[time-1]
}

head(pop_sizes)
```

```
## [1] 100.000  90.000  81.000  72.900  65.610  59.049
```

```r
# My favourite plot:
plot(x = 1:generations, y = pop_sizes, type = "l", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "generations", main = paste("R = ", RR))
```

  pop_sizes <- numeric(generations)
  pop_sizes[1] <- N_init
  for (time in 2:generations){
    pop_sizes[time] <- RR*pop_sizes[time-1]
  }
  plot(y = pop_sizes, x = 1:generations, type = "l", lwd = 2)
  return(pop_sizes)
}

# Run the function

# conditions & parameters (these are new!)
generations <- 200
rr <- .1 # R is a parameter
N_init <- 100 # N is a state variable

# create and populate pop size vector
pop_sizes <- numeric(generations)
pop_sizes[1] <- N_init

### Exercises 3.3.2

Do a systematic exploration of parameter space


```r
rrs <- c(-0.3, 0.3, 1.3, 1.9, 2.2, 2.7)

par(mfrow = c(2,3))
for(rr in rrs) {
  logistic_pop_growth(N = 10, rr = rr, generations = 20, K = 100)

### Exercise 3.3.3

Bifurcation plot


```r
rrs <- seq(from = -1, to = 3, length.out = 100)
generations <- 100
trajectories <- sapply(rrs, function(x) logistic_pop_growth(N = 10, K = 100, rr = x, generations = generations, plot = F))

# I think this is what a bifurcation plot is!
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
matplot(y = trajectories[generations, ], x = rrs, type = "l", lwd = 2, main = "Bifurcation plot?")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](figure/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png) 

```r
# Or maybe it's this, but so messy!
matplot(y = trajectories, x = rrs, type = "l", lwd = 0.5)
```

### 4.1: Differential equations with `deSolve`

The `lsoda` function in `deSolve` is a good numerical differential equation solver. 

```r
library(deSolve)

# Set up the model
expGrowthODE <- function(tt, NN, params) { # Note that this needs to be (time, init, params!)
  derivs <- params["rr"]*NN # Exponential growth equation
  return(list(derivs))  # Return the derivs 
}

# Use lsoda to run the ODE
# lsoda(initial value of state variable, time seq, user-defined model, parameters)

# Set initial and parameters
init <- 1
tseq <- seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 0.01)
parameters <- c(rr = 0.1)

pop_growth <- lsoda(init, tseq, expGrowthODE, parameters)
head(pop_growth)
```

```
##      time        1
## [1,] 1.00 1.000000
## [2,] 1.01 1.001001
## [3,] 1.02 1.002002
## [4,] 1.03 1.003005
## [5,] 1.04 1.004008
## [6,] 1.05 1.005013
```

```r
plot(x = pop_growth[, 1], y = pop_growth[, 2], type = "l", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "time", ylab = "population size")
```

### Exercise 4.2.1
Building the logistic growth model

```r

  return(list(derivs))  # Return the derivs 
}

# Set initial and parameters
init <- 10
tseq <- seq(from = 1, to = 125, by = 0.01)
parameters <- c(rr = 0.05, kk = 100)

log_pop_growth <- lsoda(init, tseq, logGrowthODE, parameters)
head(log_pop_growth)
```

```r
# plot dN/dT vs time
log_pop_growth <- data.frame(log_pop_growth)
log_pop_growth[,3] <- rep(NA, nrow(log_pop_growth))
# log_pop_growth[1, 3] <- 0
# Get dN per dt
differences <- diff(log_pop_growth[,2])
log_pop_growth[2:nrow(log_pop_growth), 3] <- differences
plot(x = log_pop_growth[, 1], y = log_pop_growth[, 3], type = "l", lwd = 2,

Playing around a bit more with the logistic growth model:


```r
# Set initial and parameters
init <- 10
tseq <- seq(from = 1, to = 125, by = 0.01)

# In exercise 3.3.2, we explored values of rr. 
# Let's do that again, but with the continuous version
# Recall that earlier, rrs <- c(-0.3, 0.3, 1.3, 1.9, 2.2, 2.7)
# We can do this in a loop.

rrs <- c(-0.3, 0.3, 1.3, 1.9, 2.2, 2.7) 
par(mfrow = c(2,3))
for (ii in rrs) {
  parameters <- c(rr = ii, kk = 100)
  log_pop_growth2 <- lsoda(init, tseq, logGrowthODE, parameters)
  head(log_pop_growth2)
  plot(y = log_pop_growth2[,2], x = log_pop_growth2[,1], type = "l", lwd = 3, xlab = "time", ylab = "population size", main = paste("r = ", ii))
  }
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](figure/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png) 

Compare this to the figure in Exercise 3.3.2, where the population sizes bounced around at higher values of R. This may because converting it to continuous time may make the model respond immediately to being close to the carrying capacity as opposed to responding to some previous time step. **look this up!**

### Exercise 4.2.2
How will the dynamics of the logistic model be impacted by harvesting (e.g. by fishing or hunting of the population)? A simple model that incorporated a constant per capita risk of being harvested is coded below:


```r
logGrowthHarvestODE <- function(tt, NN, params) { 
  derivs <- params["rr"]*NN*(1-(NN/params["kk"]))-params["h"]*NN
  return(list(derivs))  # Return the derivs 
}
```

*If you remember how, analyze this model to find its equilibria*  

**Note: still a work in progress, working on this!**
Attempt:
`dN/dT = rN*(1-N/K)*(hN) = 0`  
Equilibrium occurs where dN/dT = 0. This happens in three scenarios (at least, I think?):  
1. N = 0 (trivial)  
2. N = K(1-h/r)
3. h = r(1-N/K)


```r
init <- 10
tseq <- seq(from = 1, to = 125, by = 0.01)

log_pop_growth_harvest <- lsoda(init, tseq, logGrowthHarvestODE, parameters)
head(log_pop_growth_harvest)
```

```
##      time  1
## [1,] 1.00 10
## [2,] 1.01 NA
## [3,] 1.02 NA
## [4,] 1.03 NA
## [5,] 1.04 NA
## [6,] 1.05 NA
```

```r
# Write a function to do sensitivity to h for a given value of r

# Assume r = 0.1
# 
# hhs <- seq(from = 0, to = .125, by = 0.005)
# 
# sapply(hhs, function(x) print(x))
# 
# run_pop_growth_ode(init, tseq, log_pop_growth_harvest, parameters = c("rr = 0.1", "kk" = 100, "h" = x))
```
