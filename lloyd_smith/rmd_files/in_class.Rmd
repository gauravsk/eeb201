### Pseudocode
A program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 20


```{r}
# Set couner to 1; set Sum to counter;
# Start a loop from 1 to 20;
# Increase counter by 1; 
# Increase Sum by counter;
# Return sum

total <- 0

for (ii in 1:20){
  total <- total + ii
}

total

# Or just do this
sum(1:20)
```


Pseudocode example 2: geometric population growth
```{r}

# Make a vector of length equal to number of generations
# The first entry is the inital population size
# In a loop from 2 to number of generations, update the vector with (time-1)*R

# conditions & parameters
generations <- 20
RR <- 1.05 # R is a parameter
N_init <- 100 # N is a state variable

# create and populate pop size vector
pop_sizes <- numeric(generations)
pop_sizes[1] <- N_init
for (time in 2:generations){
  pop_sizes[time] <- RR*pop_sizes[time-1]
}

pop_sizes

# Alternatively,
for (time in 2:generations){
  pop_sizes[time] <- N_init*RR^(time-1)
}
pop_sizes

# Pseudocode for plot:
# Make a plot with X axis of 1 to number of generations
# Y axis is population size
# Plot
plot(x = 1:generations, y = pop_sizes, type = "l")

```
